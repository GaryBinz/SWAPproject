A System for Monetary Incentivization of Social Cohesion
The current system of media and news distribution and promotion through legacy media 
outlets, social media, and “influencers” operates on an underlying mechanism whereby the news, 
stories, and voices that get the most attention and distribution are those that arouse the highest levels 
of emotion. The emotions that attain the highest ROI (Return On Investment) are fear and rage. In this 
system, the outlets that are best able to foment those emotions are rewarded with clicks, engagement 
and, in turn, monetary rewards. Those outlets that do not engage in such tactics are outcompeted for 
audiences by those that perform the conversion from emotion to monetary reward most effectively. 
The mission of the SWAP Project is to utilize the functions available through cryptocurrency/blockchain 
technology to upend and supplant the current media incentive model in ways that were previously 
unavailable. The ultimate goals of the SWAP project are to 1) Utilize monetary incentives to bring about 
social cohesion, and 2) Enrich groups and individuals who participate in the process of improving our 
society. 

Corporate media and influencer's primary goal is to make money. This statement is not a judgment call; 
it is simply an obvious factor in their ability to do the job and is necessary to keep their broadcasts 
running. Some of them might very well have secondary goals, and some of those goals may be altruistic 
and/or for the benefit of the public good. However, there is rarely an instance where organizations and 
individuals don’t make concessions with logic along the lines of: “Well, if I don’t continue broadcasting, 
then I can’t get this important information to my audience. I need money to continue doing this. I will 
take this (sponsorship/deal/bribe) in order to do this important job, because ultimately I’m doing more 
good than bad.” Aside from that logic, there are plenty of information distributors who have zero regard 
for anything altruistic, or anything other than enriching themselves. It is this long-time corruption of the 
information distribution process that we wish to disrupt by subverting the traditional streams of funding 
and flows of information. Using the methods detailed in the preceding paragraphs, we believe that 
together, the people who choose to participate in this process, can truly save the world...and profit!
